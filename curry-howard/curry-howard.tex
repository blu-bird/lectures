\maketitle

Picture this: you think you have just come up with the proof of the Riemann Hypothesis, or that $\cat P \neq \cat{NP}$, or some other famous long-standing open problem. \textbf{\textit{How do you know the proof you have is correct?}} If the proof is long and/or excessively complicated, it will be difficult for people to check by hand -- as such, what if there were ways for a computer to help or even prove theorems for us?

We're going to look at how computers do this and know how to

Here's a roadmap for
